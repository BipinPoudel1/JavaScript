//Unary Operators

//1. typeof operator
console.log(typeof("Ar"));	//string
console.log(typeof(33));		//number
console.log(typeof(true));	//boolean
console.log(typeof (null));	//object
console.log(typeof(x));		//undefined


//2. Boolean Values (Only two possible values are there: True or False)
//Example
console.log(3 > 2);	//true
console.log(3<2);	//false

//Strings can also be compared like numbers 
//Example 
console.log("Aruna" < "Bipin");	//Generally, alphabetically, strings are compared but there are other specific rules also for this.
//Non alphabetic characters can also be compared



console.log("Itchy" != "Scratchy");
console.log("Apple" == "Orange");





//3. NaN (Not a Number)
//NaN is that type of value in JS which is not equal to itself
console.log(NaN == NaN);
